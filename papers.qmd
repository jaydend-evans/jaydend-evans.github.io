Going into my fourth year at UCSB I have reflected on the papers I have written throughout my time and I want to highlight some of my personal favorites here. They mostly cover sociological, historical, and political topics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper was for a European History class and covers the history of European Imperialism and some decolonization movements such as the Algerian War.

For this next paper, I wrote about some African history and how there has been a sort of revisionist history and not only a physical colonization over the people of Africa, but also a colonization of the history.

Moving into my sociology papers, this one is on Karl Marx's concept of the primitive accumulation of capital covered in volume of his series "Capital".

These next two papers were on films, the first being the film *Hunger* which covers the experiences of IRA prisoners during the hunger strikes amidst the Troubles in Northern Ireland.
