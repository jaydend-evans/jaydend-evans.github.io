They mostly cover sociological, historical, and political topics.\n\nThis paper was for a European History class and covers the history of European Imperialism and some decolonization movements such as the Algerian War.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this next paper, I wrote about some African history and how there has been a sort of revisionist history and not only a physical colonization over the people of Africa, but also a colonization of the history.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving into my sociology papers, this one is on Karl Marx’s concept of the primitive accumulation of capital covered in volume of his series “Capital”.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese next two papers were on films, the first being the film Hunger which covers the experiences of IRA prisoners during the hunger strikes amidst the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last paper is on the movie Moonlight and covers topics of gender, race and class in a character analysis of the protagonist Chiron."

    "text": "I mentioned in my bio how I am a big music fan and I wanted to highlight some of my favorite live concerts I have been to and share some photos.\n\n—\n\n\nEthel Cain\nEthel Cain is one of my favorite artists who makes indie rock, alternative pop, and some gothic music. Her live performance was amazing and her voice creates an intriguing atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cure\nThe Cure are my favorite band and I was introduced to them by my mom. I attended this concert with my mom and my sister, and it was probably my most enjoyable concert experience even though our view was far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKendrick Lamar\nMy favorite rapper is Kendrick Lamar who I had the honor of seeing live twice and this picture is from the second time at Outsidelands festival in San Francisco. His music is very powerful and he is a childhood favorite of mine. This performance was such a fun time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLana Del Rey\nLana Del Rey makes very melancholy and sad indie pop music usually dealing with romantic topics and seeing her live was a very ethereal experience. This was at the same festival where I saw the previously mentioned Kendrick Lamar and Ethel Cain performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowdive\nThe last and most recent concert was seeing the band Slowdive who are from the 1990s and make shoegaze and dream pop music. This was in Ventura, so it was the most local show and they put on an amazing performance."
